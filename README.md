## Clustering Techniques
### 1. K-Means Clustering
Description: Implemented K-Means clustering from scratch, using a synthetic dataset. The algorithm iteratively assigns points to the nearest centroid and updates the cluster centroids.
#### Highlights:
Synthetic dataset with visualizations.
Evaluation metrics: SSD and Silhouette Score.
### 2. Hierarchical Clustering
Description: Explored hierarchical clustering (agglomerative) using an existing implementation. Demonstrated dendrogram plotting and linkage methods.
#### Highlights:
Use of linkage types (e.g., single, complete).
Visualization of dendrograms for clustering insights.
### 3. Gaussian Mixture Models Clustering
Description: Used Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for clustering a dataset. GMM assumes data points are drawn from multiple Gaussian distributions.
#### Highlights:
Compared GMM with K-Means.
Visualized probability distributions.
### 4. DBSCAN Clustering using PyCaret
Description: Leveraged PyCaretâ€™s clustering module to implement DBSCAN, a density-based clustering algorithm. Showcased its ability to handle noise and non-spherical clusters.
#### Highlights:
Automatic parameter tuning.
Cluster quality evaluation.
### 5. Anomaly Detection using PyOD
Description: Demonstrated anomaly detection using PyOD (Python Outlier Detection). Worked with both univariate and multivariate data.
#### Highlights:
Applied Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM.
Evaluated using precision-recall metrics.
### 6. Time Series Clustering using Pre-Trained Models
Description: Implemented clustering of time-series data using pre-trained models and embeddings. Worked with state-of-the-art libraries.
#### Highlights:
Embedded time series into feature space.
Clustering visualization for time-series patterns.
### 7. Document Clustering with LLM Embeddings
Description: Clustered textual data using embeddings generated by state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., Sentence Transformers). Visualized the document clusters using dimensionality reduction.
#### Highlights:
Used cosine similarity for clustering.
Real-world document dataset example.
### 8. Image Clustering using ImageBind LLM Embeddings
Description: Performed clustering on images by leveraging embeddings from ImageBind, a powerful pre-trained model for multimodal embeddings.
#### Highlights:
Visualized cluster centroids as representative images.
Image similarity-based clustering.
### 9. Audio Clustering using ImageBind LLM Embeddings
Description: Clustered audio features using embeddings extracted from ImageBind. Demonstrated the grouping of similar audio samples.
#### Highlights:
