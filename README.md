Assignment Details
1. K-Means Clustering from Scratch
Implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch, showcasing how data points are grouped into clusters based on centroids.

2. Hierarchical Clustering (Not from Scratch)
An illustration of hierarchical clustering using popular Python libraries. Agglomerative clustering techniques are employed to showcase how clusters merge at different levels.

3. Gaussian Mixture Models Clustering (Not from Scratch)
Application of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for clustering, highlighting the probabilistic assignment of data points to clusters.

4. DB Scan Clustering Using PyCaret Library
A demonstration of the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) method using the PyCaret library, highlighting its ability to detect clusters of arbitrary shape.

5. Anomaly Detection Using pyOD
Using the pyOD library, this task demonstrates anomaly detection with a real-world use case to identify outliers in the dataset.

6. Clustering of Time Series Data Using Pretrained Models
Illustration of clustering for time series data using pretrained models to extract embeddings and group similar temporal patterns.

7. Clustering of Documents Using State-of-the-Art Embeddings (LLM Embeddings)
A Colab notebook demonstrating the clustering of text documents using embeddings generated by state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs).

8. Clustering with Images Using ImageBind LLM Embeddings
A Colab notebook showcasing clustering of images with embeddings extracted using the ImageBind model.

9. Audio Embeddings Clustering Using ImageBind LLMs
A Colab notebook illustrating clustering with audio embeddings generated by the ImageBind model.
